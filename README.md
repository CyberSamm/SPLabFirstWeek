Linux scripting and source control.

## Explanation of the scripts:
1. Script **AllFileNames.sh** prints all file names on given folder with subfolders.
2. Script **CheckingFiles.sh** prompts the user for a name of a file or directory and reports if it is a regular file, a directory.
3. Script **CountLinesInFile.sh** counts lines in file given in argument.
4. Script **ReverseNum.sh** prints a number in reverse order.

## CMake:
The CMake directory contains *the cmake file, two .cpp files with header file and build.sh clean.sh scripts.* **CMake file** builds and links .cpp files. **build.sh** script make *build* directory, call cmake, make and run the resulting executable file. **clean.sh** script deletes files created during building.
  
## TEST:
The TEST directory contains *scripts and some other files for testing AllFileNames.sh CheckingFiles.sh CountLinesInFile.sh ReverseNum.sh scripts*.
